# Intro-to-Keras-Neural-Networks
This program was designed to give me a little of experience working with Keras, a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and ran on top of Tensorflow. This program was my first experience working with neural networks.

You will need to install the latest edition of Tensorflow, Keras, and matplotlib. The program will not compile if you are running a version of Python that is OLDER than 3.7 as of 4/23/2020, as Tensorflow does not support Python 3.8 yet.
